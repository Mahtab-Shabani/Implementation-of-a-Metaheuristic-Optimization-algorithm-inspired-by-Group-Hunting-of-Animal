# Implementation-of-a-Metaheuristic-Optimization-algorithm-inspired-by-Group-Hunting-of-Animal

This repository is an implementation of the paper below:

**"A novel meta-heuristic optimization algorithm inspired by group hunting of animals: Hunting search. R. Oftadeh, et al."** 


There are three functions including:
```
%function1
Z=(X-Y).^2+((X+Y-10)/3).^2;

%function2
Z=(X.^2+Y.^2);

%function3
Z=100*(X.^2-Y)+(X-1).^2;
```

Basic Usage
===========

1. Before running, select a function.
2. Run the 'hunting_search.m' script.
